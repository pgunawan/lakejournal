           <p>The main text of the following interview with Canadian artist Kristi Malakoff took place during her artist residency at SÍM, in Reykjavík, Iceland, in late 2006 through early 2007, and closes with postscript comments from the artist after having moved to Berlin in August. Kristi Malakoff grew up in Naramata, in the south Okanagan, and graduated from Penticton Secondary School in 1992. In 2001 she enrolled in Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design, where she graduated with a BFA in 2005. Since then her art career has been on a steady ascendancy on a national, and an increasingly<br />
             international scale.<br />
           </p>
           <p><strong>Gary Pearson</strong></p>
          <p>You had a show at the Alternator Gallery in Kelowna in May; you were in a group show at Artspeak, in Vancouver, followed by solo shows in Calgary, and Toronto. And you managed to take a quick holiday jaunt down to Las Vegas prior to your flight to Reykjavík. What was it like to exit North America after this flurry of activity, and find yourself in Iceland?</p>
          <p><strong>Kristi Malakoff</strong></p>
          <p>It was great to finally land in Iceland. I have been thinking and dreaming of this country for years now, so it is<br />
            really something to be here at last. I had such a strong reaction when I first saw land, after crossing that big expanse of water. The southern landscape, on the way to Reykjavík, is unbelievably stark and unpopulated, and you can see wisps of steam from the hot springs rising up from the tundra all around.</p>
          <p>Iceland falls directly on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and contains both the North American and the Eurasian Plates—both of which are constantly shifting—so it’s an incredibly dynamic place. In some places, in the centre of Iceland, you can look down between the plates—the earth has actually split open at this point. It’s the youngest country in the world, and is, in fact, still forming. In 1963, after a volcanic eruption, an entirely new island pushed to the surface, and it was subsequently named Surtsey. It’s truly a place like no other—a land of volcanoes, lava fields, glaciers,<br />
            geysers and hot springs.</p>
          <p><strong>gp:</strong> What’s it like in Reykjavík? Is it anything like Las Vegas?</p>
          <p><strong>km:</strong> I’m living right in the middle of downtown Reykjavík—an amazing location, though hideously loud on the weekends. The residency is organized through an Icelandic organization called SÍM. I’m sharing the flat with an artist from Switzerland. SÍM has another residency flat in Reykjavík in which are staying an artist from Berlin and another from Iceland/Glasgow. Both flats also contain a guest suite, so there is a steady flow of art-related people coming and going. Right now, we have a Chicago-based Norwegian art historian staying here while she does research. Last week, a New York-based curator/artist was staying here while he executed a performance piece whereby he buried a time capsule filled with stolen goods in an undisclosed Icelandic location. There’s also an American art collective staying down the road, performing what they call the “Living Restaurant”—an outdoor restaurant that provides free, large-scale community dinners.</p>
          <p>I don’t think many people would draw comparisons between Reykjavík and Las Vegas! Perhaps in the intensity with which the people in both places live. The fervor with which you see people playing the slots in Vegas is the same fervor that you see in the Icelandic people as they party on the weekends! And live the rest of their lives, for that matter! The Icelandic people work more hours per week, on average, than any other country in Europe. It is common for people here to have three or four jobs, to be an artist, and to be involved in numerous other events/collectives/organizations. Also, people start having kids quite young here, so they are often juggling a family too. It seems it is quite hip to have children if you are an artist, so kids are definitely a staple at the all openings here.</p>
          <p>We are right in the middle of a huge, international time-based media and performance art festival called Sequences. Every day, there has been a full schedule of completely over-the-top performances around the city. You name it—nudity, feigned suicides, group mortality, puppet shows, sing-a-longs etc.—it’s all here.</p>
          <p>The Nordic Music festival ended last week as well. I saw a premiere performance of the Iceland Dance Company last weekend. The final piece involved an Icelandic death metal band that came on stage, shirtless, with leather chaps, and head banged to some insanely gnarly tunes while the dancers ran around screaming like banshees, whipping hundreds of apples across the stage and at each other. I also saw a contemporary Danish organist who played a set of amazing pipes at a stunning church here in Reykjavík. To top it all off, the Iceland Airwaves music festival ended on Sunday—hundreds of acts from around the world. It lasted for five days with six venues...</p>
