          <img src="images/illustrations/fall09_bill_bourne_image1.jpg" width="175" height="165" class="articleillustration" />
          <p class="author"><strong>a conversation with Bill Burns by Renay Egami</strong></p>
          <p>A children’s choir whose repertoire consists of the sounds of dogs, boats and airplanes, Italian mineral water for the Masked Puddle Frog, and a prosthetics program for animals with missing body parts: these are some of the ways in which artist Bill Burns considers the tensions between nature and culture. For the past twenty years, Burns has produced conceptually and socially engaged work that reminds us of what’s at stake both globally and closer to home.</p>

          <p class="author"><strong>Lorin Schwartz</strong></p>
          <p>The interpretation of others is always an interesting place to begin thinking about a paper, and this one began at just such an occasion. Halfway through reading Whetstone1, a collection of poetry by British Columbian poet Lorna Crozier, I came across an article on the post-colonial poetics of Canadian literature. Whetstone was assigned reading for my final advanced doctoral methods course, a requirement in most faculties of education.</p>

          <p>Born in 1911, Joan Heriot has had two remarkable, long-spanning careers in her lifetime: one as a scientist, the other as an artist. Seen here are several<br />
            drawings of microscopic cross-sections of plants and of bones which Heriot produced for her scientific studies at university during the 1930s. These drawings<br />
            have been reproduced from her notebooks which now belong to Okanagan<br />
            College in Vernon, British Columbia.</p>

          <p>We’ve talked for hours without really saying a thing. Have you noticed the winters keep getting longer? The sign by the lake’s edge warned not to walk across and pictured a stick man falling through the ice. In general, he had a hard time dealing with more than one thing at once, and so, pleaded for silence.</p>

          <p class="author"><img src="images/illustrations/fall09_tiborah_bea_image1.jpg" width="175" height="165" class="articleillustration" /></p>
          <p>My work dives deep into the cracks, the gaps between the rustic natural land, and the concrete confines of man. It is the interface between earth and man that is in constant flux. My art seeks to identify and document this interface, whether it is a plant springing up in the space between the curb or the trimming of trees to make way for electrical poles. The dichotomy of Nature and Man has informed and intrigued my lens.</p>

          <p class="articletitle">A Pine to Ponder</p>
          <p class="author"><img src="images/illustrations/fall09_a_pine_to_ponder.jpg" width="175" height="165" class="articleillustration" />Don Gayton</p>
          <p>Trees do speak of local place, and none more so than the ponderosa pine. A tree native to southern British Columbia and native to northern Mexico, it defines dry landscapes from the Cascades and Sierras all the way eastward to the Hundredth Meridian.</p>

          <p>I have walked uphill all morning. The meadows were triads of wildflowers: field chickweed, larkspur, buffalo bean, the meadows edged with white spruce and aspen, a few pines higher up. It was a long, steep climb, the land levelling to a sudden, miles-wide plateau of fescue and brome, distant dots of Black Angus, horizons of nothing but pine. </p>
